📄 About data.jsx

    The data.jsx file currently stores static sample data for testing and development purposes.
    It includes:

    Events Data – Titles, descriptions, dates of cybersecurity events.

    Resources Data – Links and details of learning resources.

    Members Data – Sample profiles of association members.

    This will later be replaced with dynamic data from a database (MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL).

🌍 Future Enhancements

    ✅ User authentication (Admin, Members, Guests).

    ✅ Database integration for dynamic event & resource management.

    ✅ Dashboard for admins to add/manage content.

    ✅ Chat or discussion forum for members.
